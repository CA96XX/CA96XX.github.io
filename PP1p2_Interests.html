		<h1> <u> Who I Am </u> </h1>
			<p class="blue2"> Ever since I was young I had taken an interest in sports-- though these days I must confess I get much more out of following current events worldwide than I ever did out of examining scoreboards. This page is going to be used to tell you a little about how I feel in regards to athletics. </p>
			<p> If I were to rank my five favorite sports by watchability, the table would look something like this.. </p>

		<table>
			<tr> <th> SPORT </th> <th> RANK </th> </tr> 
			<tr> <td> MMA/UFC </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> NBA Basketball </td> <td> 2 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> NFL Football </td> <td> 3 </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> MX Motocross </td> <td> 4 </td> </tr> 
			<tr> <td> MLB Baseball </td> <td> 5 </td> </tr> 
		</table>

			<p class="blue2"> If I were to rank my favorite sports by playability, the list would probably go on forever in no specific order; though it might end up looking something like.. 

			<h2> SPORTS </h2> 
				<ul> 
					<li> Basketball </li> 
					<li> Football </li> 
					<li> Boxing </li> 
					<li> Driving </li> 
					<li> Tennis </li> 
					<li> Swimming </li> 
					<li> Baseball </li> 
				</ul>  </p>
