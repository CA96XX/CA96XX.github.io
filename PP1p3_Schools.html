		<h1> <u> Who I Am </u> </h1>
			<p class="green1"> Throughout my course of growing up I had a few times switched schools. Though not the worst thing imaginable, going from private to public was something that I found to be somewhat difficult. It took some getting used to, to say the least. </p>
			<p class="green2"> Making friends and then leaving those friends behind, time and time again, proved to be somewhat difficult for me. I had throughout the course of my childhood switched school districts three times-- each time seemingly "at the good part" -- being when I built friendships that I valued. </p>
			<p class="green3"> If, say, my childhood situation in regards to schools were to be illustrated by a table, that table would look like this,

				<table> 
			<tr> <th> AGE </th> <th> SCHOOL </th> </tr> 
			<tr> <td> 3-5 </td> <td> St. Paul's </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> 6-8 </td> <td> St. Helen's </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> 9-10 </td> <td> St. Alexander's </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> 11-12 </td> <td> Pleasant View </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> 13-14 </td> <td> Forest Park </td> </tr>
			<tr> <td> 15-18 </td> <td> Franklin High </td> </tr> </table> </p>
