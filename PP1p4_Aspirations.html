				<p> Though I cannot foresee my future through any crystal balls, I will hopefully be able to -- by taking the proper steps -- set myself up with a degree of certainty in regards to what comes next, as well as when. </p>
				<p> I am currently looking forward to things like traveling as well as building a family. Hopefully someday the two will be going hand in hand, no pun intended. </p>
